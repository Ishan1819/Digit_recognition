Digit Recognition System

This project implements a digit recognition system that predicts the digit from a given image. The model uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers along with pooling layers to process the image and produce the output.
The model was trained for 10 epochs and achieved an accuracy of over 98% on the test data, demonstrating strong performance in recognizing handwritten digits.
